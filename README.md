# journal-down

## Journal in Markdown, using MacDown, backed up to your iCloud.

## About:

Lately I've been finding most of my productive writing has been occurring in Markdown. Specifically, I enjoy using [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com). 

To jumpstart more habitual writing, I wanted dead-simple, 0-dependency, Markdown journaling.

1. From desire to write, to actually writing, as quickly as possible.
2. Automatic backups to the iCloud storage I already pay for so I don't have to configure or worry about anything.

Upon searching around, most of the stuff in the simple Markdown journal category came with a lot of extra fluff, required Dropbox, or had a host of dependencies.

This is JournalDown.

## How it Works:

1. When you run `journal-down` it will create a file for you in your iCloud storage like this: `/JournalDown/2017/09/2017-09-10.md`
2. JournalDown will add a header to the file with the current date, and day of the week like: `# September 11th, 2017 - Monday`
3. Additionally, JournalDown will create a subheading with the current time like: `## 08:44 PM`
4. MacDown will open with the current file and your cursor on a new line ready to type.
5. Simply `âŒ˜-Q` out of MacDown when you're finished.
6. Come back and start writing again by running `journal-down` and MacDown will open today's journal, add newlines, create a timestamp subheading, and your cursor will be ready to write.

Simple, easy, Markdown journaling.

That is JournalDown.

## Requirements

* macOS
* MacDown - The Open Source Markdown editor for macOS ([https://macdown.uranusjr.com](https://macdown.uranusjr.com))
* iCloud Storage - Default setup.

## Installation

Be sure you've installed MacDown. Copy the `journal-down` file to an accessible location like your Home Directory. Make sure the file is executable with: `chmod +x journal-down`. Run `journal-down` and start typing.

## Help

For help using `journal-down` you can use the `-h` flag like:

`journal-down -h`

It will print the following:

    https://macdown.uranusjr.com

Usage:
    journal-down                      Open journal file for today with a new timestamp.

    journal-down -o                   Open journal for today.
    journal-down -r <YYYY-MM-DD>      Open a journal for a given valid date like: 2017-09-10.
```

## Development:

This was a pretty fun project that I have a feeling I'll be re-visiting quite a bit. Originally, I wrote this as a PHP script since that's the language I'm most comfortable in. 

While the PHP script did the job, it had two problems:

1. PHP was a dependency. I wanted something that was dead easy to get running on a Mac with MacDown installed.
2. It was verbose.

I knew that BASH would be a better choice from the get-go, so I went ahead and decided to dust off the ol' BASH-hacking skills. Unfortunately, I couldn't find them anywhere in the noggin so I checked up on some of the current best practices, and leaned on a few people in `#bash` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net) to come up with what we've got here.

There's probably some ways I could improve things, so please feel free to open some issues or throw some pull requests in there.
